## Advantages of GANs
- Amazing empirical results - especially with fidelity (high quality results)
- Fast inference (image generation during testing)

## Disadvantages of GANs
- Lack of intrinsic evaluation metrics
- Unstable training (Mode Collapse)
- No Density estimation
- Inverting is not straightforward (Challenging to invert image to its latent space representation)
 ** GANs - There can be great fidelity (empirically) but there is instability during training.
